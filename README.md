# Bluefin

Bluefin is an effect system for Haskell which allows you, through
value-level handles, to freely mix a variety of effects
including

* [`Bluefin.EarlyReturn`](bluefin/src/Bluefin/EarlyReturn.hs), for early return
* [`Bluefin.Exception`](bluefin/src/Bluefin/Exception.hs), for exceptions
* [`Bluefin.IO`](bluefin/src/Bluefin/IO.hs), for I/O
* [`Bluefin.State`](bluefin/src/Bluefin/State.hs), for mutable state
* [`Bluefin.Stream`](bluefin/src/Bluefin/Stream.hs), for streams

## Introduction

For an introduction to Bluefin, see the docs in the
[`Bluefin`](bluefin/src/Bluefin.hs) module.

## Examples

There is an `bluefin-examples` package which you can see in this
repository at
[`bluefin-examples/src/Bluefin/Examples`](bluefin-examples/src/Bluefin/Examples).

to effect systems.  Without the work of these individuals, Bluefin
would not exist.
