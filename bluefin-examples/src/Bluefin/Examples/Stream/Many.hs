-- `connectMany` is the part of this program that behaves in the
-- least familiar manner. This is what it does:
--
-- When given a list of n effectful operations which yield `a`s it
-- forks n threads for them to run in. There is also a thread forked
-- for the function that accepts a list of `Consume`s. Each `Consume`
-- receives the `a`s yielded by one of the n threads.
--
-- The threads are synchronised by `MVar`s, so there is only one
-- possible interleaving of the concurrent code. When `await` is
-- called on one of the n `Consume`s the `Stream` thread corresponding
-- to that `Consume` is asked "please do the work required to get
-- me your next `a`". That unblocks it, it does its work, gives its `a`,
-- blocks, and the `Consume` thread continues.
--
-- (Actually, there are n threads forked for the `Consume` action,
-- but it only runs in the last one. This is not an essential feature,
-- it's just how the current implementation happens to work.)
